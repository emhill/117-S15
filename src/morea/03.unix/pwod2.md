# Practice WOD2: UNIX Command Overview

For each of the following commands:

A. Briefly describe what it does in your own words. Example: 

    wget downloads files from the internet


B. Write a template of how the command is used -- indicate arguments in [brackets]. For example, a template for the wget command would look like this:

    wget [url to download]


C. Take a screenshot of using the command on your terminal (please crop irrelevant parts<!--, but make sure to show your prompt so I can see it’s your computer and not someone else’s)-->. You should make sure the command works in the screen shot.

   Example for **wget**:

   <a href="wget.png"><img src="wget.png" width="500"/></a>

   Example for **remove** needs to show the file is no longer there:

   <a href="rm.png"><img src="rm.png" width="300"/></a>

Your document should be organized by command -- for example, you should describe the ls command, give its template, and include a cropped screenshot before moving on to the next command, pwd.

**Commands:**

1. ls
1. pwd
1. cd
1. touch
1. mkdir
1. cp
1. mv
1. rm
1. ped
1. cat
1. zip    
1.  .      (not a command, use in conjunction with another command)
1. ..      (not a command, use in conjunction with another command)
1. tab     (no screenshot necessary)
1.  ↑      (no screenshot necessary)
