# Practice WOD5: For loops

In this practice WOD you will create 2 programs that use for loops.

## hello_loops.py

Create a program that does the following:

1. Print the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Each number should be on a separate line.
1. Print the multiples of 5 from 10 through -25 (inclusive). The numbers should each be separated by a space. (*Hint*: use the `end` parameter to the print function like we did in class; see loop_fun.py.) Donâ€™t forget to print a newline after this loop by calling `print()` with no parameters.
1. Print the multiples of 3 from -3 to 21 (inclusive). Each number should be separated by a comma and a space. There should not be a comma after the final number (21). 

## average.py

Create a program that calculates the average of a series of 10 real (i.e., decimal) numbers entered by the user. The user should enter ten numbers, hitting enter after each number. Make sure you ask (i.e., prompt) the user to enter each number. Note the loop will require two numbers to calculate the average: the sum and the number of numbers entered by the user (10).
