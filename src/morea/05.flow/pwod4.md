# Practice WOD4: Input & Ifs

In this practice WOD you will create 3 programs that explore getting user input and using if statements.

## temperature.py

Create a program that asks the user for the current temperature and outputs what they should wear. Your program should meet the following requirements:

1. Has a variable, `temp`, that stores the temperature input from the user
2. Requests the user to enter the temperature
3. Displays the following information based on the temperature range:
    * Above 90: “Whoa, it’s boiling!”
    * Above or equal to 80: “It’s getting hot”
    * Below 80: “A perfect day”
    * Below 60: “Don’t forget your sweater”
    * Below freezing: “Brrr, you need a coat!”

Only one phrase should be displayed to the user for any given temperature input.

## absolute_value.py

Create a program that asks the user for a number and prints its absolute value ***without*** using any python functions (in other words, you should use an if statement). 

## is_multiple.py

Create a program that asks the user for a whole number and prints whether it's a multiple of 5. Make sure to test the program by inputting a positive and a negative number. (*Hint*: what arithmetic operator can you use to determine whether a number is a multiple of another?)
