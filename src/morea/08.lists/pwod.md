# Practice WOD8: Recursion & Lists

<!--In this practice WOD you will create 5 programs that take code we've previously written for other PWODs and turns them into functions.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<20 min" Av="20-40 min" Sd="40-60 min" DNF="60+ min" %}

## hello_function.py

Write a function `hello` which takes a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, ..." and replacing the ellipsis (...) with the parameter. Test your function by asking the user for their name.
-->

## Demonstration

*Coming soon...*

<!--Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, you can watch me do it:

{% include youtube.html id="0BPlMXkwdcY" %}

{% include wod-warning.html %}-->
